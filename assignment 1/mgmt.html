                    This 2-year Master of Business Administration (MBA) program focuses on strategic, specialized and advanced courses across the functional areas of business. Additionally, this intellectually-stimulating program is designed with a view to 'researching' local & regional management phenomena rather than merely 'studying' them. Students are taught decision-making skills through qualitative and quantitative analysis and are expected to offer vibrancy to the corporate culture. This program is intended to produce managers and business administrators who are ready to face multi-dimensional and complex real-life business problems and who can provide effective and efficient solutions to such problems.                </p>
