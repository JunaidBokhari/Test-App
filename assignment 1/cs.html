                <p>
                    The purpose of Computer Science degree programs is to produce computer scientists, who can form the backbone of the rapidly growing computer industry. The BS program is focused on developing an in depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science through a rigorous course work spanning over a period of four years. Students are given unique opportunities to go beyond traditional computer science and get themselves involved in research activities through various research and industrial collaboration programs carried out at the campuses. This ensures a broad based educational foundation that prepares them for leadership roles along diverse career paths.

                    The MS (Computer Science) comprises course work and research component. It has four 'core courses' aimed at strengthening the understanding and competence in computer science fundamentals. The University expects its MS graduates to pursue careers either as 'Computer Science Faculty Members' or as 'Software Development Managers' in the industry.
